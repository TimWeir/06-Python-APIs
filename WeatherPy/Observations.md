WeatherPy Observations

There is almost no data on the southern most latitudes on each scatter plot.  This could be due to substantially less land mass at those latitudes compared to their corresponding latitudes in the northern hemisphere.

Wind speeds tend to show the largest outlier impact.  This could be due to the rarety of extreme weather in these cities.

The "Northern Hemisphere Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression" plot has the steepest slope and the "Northern Hemisphere Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Linear Regression" has the slightest slope.
